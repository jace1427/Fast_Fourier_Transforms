Document is missing milestones - I would like to know exactly what you plan to do when.

Overall, the area of FFT is a good one to work on, as it has a long history and large application.
However, based on what is in the document, the workload seems light.

I would suggest adding more to this, or find a way to justify what you have proposed would be enough for two students.
Either send me an email or come speak with me during Office hours.
